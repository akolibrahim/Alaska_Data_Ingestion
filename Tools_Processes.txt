Data Capture Methods/Tools


1) Adobe Analytics: I would choose Adobe Analytics for Alaska's data capture needs. Data collection process works as simple as sending visitor interactions with Alaska to Adobe server. 
					Adobe stores that data in it's report suites. Users can then access report suite data and generate reports related to visitor activity on alaskaair.com.
	A) Pros:
		a) Fantastic dashboarding and reporting support!
		b) Easy automation, data gathering and cleaning
		c) Helps to get a great view of the customer Journeys and Clickstream data
		d) Ability to drill down into the details
		e) Large variety of different metrics and dimensions (very customizable)
	B) Cons:
		a) Initial setup might take time and effort
		b) Data validation does not always match 100%
		c) It might be advanced and complicated for some users
		d) Slow sometimes

2) Google Analytics And Tag Manager:
	A) Pros:
		a) Easy to setup and use (and free)
		b) Good amount of resources available for support
		c) Ability to easily integrate to Google's Big Query for reporting
		d) Easy code management and readily available custom code
		e) Track customer behavior (complete purchase, abandon cart, conversion rate, etc.)
	B) Cons:
		a) Google Tag Manager can be error-prone if the code is not implemented correctly (duplicate tracking, etc.)
		b) Not a good solution if lot of detailed information is needed
		c) The data that Google provides is highly limiting
		d) Still requires technical knowledge to implement (too complicated for non-technicals)

3) Looker Analytics:
	A) Pros:
		a) User friendly
		b) Ability to quickly connect to data sources
		c) Highly customizable dashboards
	B) Cons:
		a) Charts could be "basic" for some users
		b) Deep learning curve
		c) Could be slow for large and complex queries
		
4) MS Azure - Data Factory/Logic Apps:
	A) Pros:
		a) Fast and Reliable
		b) Cloud based
		c) Alaska already has this!
		d) Relatively easy to use with drag and drop interface
	B) Cons:
		a) Expensive
		b) Not as intuitive as the above solutions
		c) Primarily good for data collection/copy (No dashboarding or KPI support)
		
5) Data Ingestion Using Python
	A) Pros:
		a) Free and Open Source!
		b) Many ready to use libraries and APIs
	B) Cons:
		a) Expert knowledge of Python and coding required
